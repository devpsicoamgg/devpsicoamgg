  <h1 align="center"> Hi there! 👋 </h1>

  <h3 align="center"> I'm a 43-year-old Colombian psychologist 👨🏻‍💼 who wants to become a full-stack developer 🧑🏻‍💻.

  Some might say I traded mind-reading 🧠 for code-reading. 
  let = true; 😉

  I'm passionate about technology and enjoy finding elegant, efficient, effective, and syntactically readable solutions to problems that arise.

  When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring nature ⛰️, training my dogs 🐕, or taking care of my plants 🌿.

  Thanks for visiting 🔍 my profile, and I promise not to psychoanalyze your code!</h3>
