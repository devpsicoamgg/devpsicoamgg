		<h1 align="center">Hi there! 👋</h1>
		<p>I'm a 43-year-old Colombian psychologist 👨🏻‍💼 who wants to become a full-stack developer 🧑🏻‍💻.</p>
		<p>Some might say I traded mind-reading 🧠 for code-reading. <code>let = true; 😉</code></p>
		<p>I'm passionate about technology and enjoy finding elegant, efficient, effective, and syntactically readable solutions to problems that arise.</p>
		<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring nature ⛰️, training my dogs 🐕, or taking care of my plants 🌿.</p>
		<p>Thanks for visiting 🔍 my profile, and I promise not to psychoanalyze your code!</p>
